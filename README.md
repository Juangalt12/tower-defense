# Hello, This is an epic open-source tower-defense game
## for developers that will actually contribute, do git clone this repo then cd into it and do `npm install` to download its dependencies then do `npm run game` to start the developement server and it will host at `localhost` but the development server is actually not going to the write path (see issue above) so you will need to go to `localhost/webpack-dev-server` then you click on the last link and everytime u make a change, go back to that site and refresh :D
